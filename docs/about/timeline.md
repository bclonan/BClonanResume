### WireFrame - Design

**1-2 Weeks**

During this stage, we will build wireframes or working demos based off of the platform inspirations, client suggestions, needs, and professional experience. During this stage,we encourage soft changes to core functionalities and constructive criticism.
Upon completion, phylat will provide a final wireframe/interactive demo based for approval before moving on to any serious development.

### Developement - Local/Test Environment

**1-2 Weeks**

During this phase, our coding wizards get to work and develop your software. Our team offers occasional updates, little demos and platform permitting UI/UX previews.  

### Final Approval - Transfer Ownership

**2 Days**

Congrats!! Your software is ready to go, launch and transfer over to your servers. Our team transfer everything over to get your software running in tip top shape. 10 days of server/software monitoring is included with all projects to ensure the transition went smoothly. 


### Ongoing Retainer - Sleep in peace

**1/mo-10/yrs**

While we stand behind all of our software 100% there are times when you rather leave the monitering, server maintinence, server usages etc. Our fully managed retainer option allows you to make changes to ui/ux based off of core functionality. Style changes, and puts a phylat developer on the clock monitering your servers to make sure no funny business is affot.
