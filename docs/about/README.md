## 'Road' to Code

**Developing is atune to modern day painting through your keyboard**

A software engineer to me is the bittersweet balance between art and science, it is our duty to bring our ideas to fruition to both better peoples lives through innovation and enjoyment.

Like many my interest in developing software began at a very early age. I began developing as soon as my local library got their first computer and I could get a hold of some of the books.

Initially, I fully intended on solely developing video games cause hey who did not want to make the next **Oregon trail**. However, over time my purpose has shifted to developing sustainable tools to help improve peoples lives.

From business management to artificial networks designed to create alternative rehabilitation methods and everything in between I believe it is our duty as software engineers to provide solutions that are both usable and maintainable.
