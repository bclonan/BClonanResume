# Intro

The best way to learn technology in my experience is the pursuit of solving problems. Due to the number of issues that exist there is no shortage of learning, and therefore is a great career to be in. In my eyes, there will always be a developer or non-developer who can offer insight or out of the box solutions to a software related solution you seek to solve. I have mastered a handful of languages though have not limited myself to just a few.
